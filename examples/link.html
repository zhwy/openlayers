title: Map Link
shortdesc: Synchronizing map state with the URL.
docs: >
  The `Link` interaction allows you to synchronize the map state with the URL.
  The view center, zoom level, and rotation will be reflected in the URL as you
  navigate around the map.  Layer visibility is also reflected in the URL.
  Reloading the page restores the map view state.
